P9-15. Figure 9.7 shows a system as either a host or a router. What would be the actual entity (host or router) of system A and B in each of the following cases:
a. If the link is the first one in the path?
b. If the link is the middle one in the path?
c. If the link is the last one in the path?
d. If there is only one link in the path (local communication)?

A) network상에 경로에서 첫번째에 위치하려면 해당 entity는 패킷이 생성되는 Host이어야한다.

B)  network상의 중간에 위치하려면 end-To-end address 사이를 연결하는 Router이어야한다.

C) path의 마지막에 위치하려면 기본적으로는 Host이지만 경우에 따라 Router일수 있다.

D) Local Network상에서는 Host이어야한다.

P12-15. Assume that there are only two stations, A and B, in a bus CSMA/CD network. The distance between the two stations is 2000 m and the propagation speed is 2 × 108 m/s. If station A starts transmitting at time t1:
a. Does the protocol allow station B to start transmitting at time t1 + 8 μs? If
the answer is yes, what will happen?

B는 전송을 허용한다. 왜냐하면 A에서 출발한 신호가 B에 도착하기 전에, 채널이 충돌을 감지할수 있는 조건이 생기기전에 B가 Colision 검사를 시도하기 때문이다.

b. Does the protocol allow station B to start transmitting at time t1 + 11 μs? If
the answer is yes, what will happen?

B는 전송을 허용하지 않는다. 이미 A에서 출발한 신호가 B에 도착하여 B는 Colision을 우려해 전송을 중지한다.



P12-18. In a bus 1-persistence CSMA/CD with Tp = 50 μs and Tfr = 120 μs, there are two stations, A and B. Both stations start sending frames to each other at the same time. Since the frames collide, each station tries to retransmit. Station A comes out with R = 0 and station B with R = 1. Ignore any other delay including
the delay for sending jamming signals. Do the frames collide again? Draw a time-line diagram to prove your claim. Does the generation of a random number help avoid collision in this case?

도움이 되었다, R의 차이로 한쪽의 Back off Time동안  전송을 지연했다가 다른 한쪽에서 전송을 마무리할 시간을 벌었다.
